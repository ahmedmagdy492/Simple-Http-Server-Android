# Simple-Http-Server-Android
- is a simple (outdated) android app that is created for educational purposes only and to get my hands dirty with how the http protocol works.
- in this app i have used some features from the HTTP/1.0 protocol such as different content types other than html.
- the app has a small tiny bug when it tries to decode the + sign, so when the file name to download contains a + sign it treats it as a special character so that it does not include the + sign itself in the url so the server will respond with 404 File Not Found
